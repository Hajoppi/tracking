Associations will also get points by adding their event to the All to X-calendar (instructions <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16krtNQo70BIhUuaw91saLcRNeLSXI14awMrSFYwHBUI/edit?usp=sharing" title="docs"> here</a>). You will get the event points by scanning the QR code in the event.

      you will be awarded extra points!-->
