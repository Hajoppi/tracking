        We use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic
        analysis. In order to track session usage, GA drops a cookie (_ga) with
        a randomly-generated ClientID in the user's browser. This ID is
        anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone
        number, name, etc. We also anonymize the user's IP-address. We use GA to
        track the user's All To X website behaviour, such as what pages the user
        looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is important to us
        for improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness. We
        store no identifiable information about your visits to GA.

        information that has been saved in the register and demand for
        corrections if any information is incorrect or missing. If the person
        wishes to see the information the register has on them or requests for a
        correction, the request must be sent to the controller of the register
        in writing.<br /><br />
        The controller of the register can ask the sender of the request to
        verify their identity. The controller of the register will answer the
        requesting party within the time limit specified by the GDPR (primarily
        within one month).

        timeframe, at most within one month from the decision of expulsion or
